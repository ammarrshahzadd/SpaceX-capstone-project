# SpaceX capstone project

The aim of this project is to predict if the Falcon 9 first stage will land successfully. SpaceX advertises Falcon 9 rocket launches on its website, with a cost of 62 million dollars; other providers cost upward of 165 million dollars each, much of the savings is because SpaceX can reuse the first stage. Therefore, if we can determine if the first stage will land, we can determine the cost of a launch. This information can be used if an alternate company wants to bid against SpaceX for a rocket launch.

# Methodology
- The data collection was done using SpaceX REST API 

- Performed data wrangling
One hot encoding data fields for machine learning and dropping irrelevant
columns (Transforming data for Machine Learning)

- Performed exploratory data analysis (EDA) using visualization and SQL using scatter and bar graphs to show patterns between data

- Performed interactive visual analytics using Folium and Plotly Dash using Folium and Plotly Dash Visualizations

- Performed predictive analysis using classification models Dash build and evaluate classification models
